1. We had help from Lauren, specifically on how exactly to work the while loop, and from Prof. Harrington about the limit function.
2. It took about 7 days’ worth of time, with 1-2 hours per day, both in and out of class.
3. The hardest part was the main function itself: The correct way to put the while loop.
4. Yes, the spread-out due dates certainly helped.  We were able to plan ahead of time, and while we didn’t follow it perfectly, we feel that we did what we needed to do and more.
5. As usual, I worked with Demilade Akin-Lewis.
6. We did very well together.  She definitely had a great amount of input with the project, and I thank her for that.
